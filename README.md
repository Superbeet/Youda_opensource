Welcome to Project Youda!
===================
One year ago, we founded the first alumni-based education and career website in China named UAnswerMe (友答)。 
During the online running of the first year, we added in 10 more features and optimized the architecture in
Many aspects. Today, we have more than 50,000 users, 90% of which are located in Nanjing. We do hope more 
cities and universities can have their own platforms for people to share knowledges and experience in their lives,
so we decides to open source our code completely. 

Free feel to use the code to build a non-commerical websites and help others. Commerical usage will be limited, send 
an Email to jeffrey.congye@gmail.com for detailed information. 

If you find any issue or build a awesome feature that you want to share with us and others, just send us a pull reqeust.
